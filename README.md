# HTML & CSS Bootstrap Layout Exercise

This is a **student exercise** for practicing **Bootstrap 5 responsive grid layouts**. The goal was to reproduce a multi-column layout that adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes.

The exercise also includes a **bonus** part to practice **centralization** of both text color and column layout.

## Features Implemented

1. **Responsive Grid Layout**  
   - Used Bootstrap 5 `row` and `col` classes to create different layouts for **small (sm), medium (md), and large (lg)** devices.
   - Three main layout areas, each with a different column structure:
     - **First area:** 2 columns, width adjusts per screen size.
     - **Second area:** 3 columns, width adjusts per screen size.
     - **Third area:** 4 columns, width adjusts per screen size.

2. **Text & Column Centralization (Bonus)**  
   - Centralized headings and texts using `text-center`.
   - Centered columns for specific rows using Bootstrap's `row-cols-*` classes.

3. **Styling & Colors**  
   - Applied different background colors to distinguish columns.
   - Used `text-white` or `text-dark` to ensure readable text on colored backgrounds.
